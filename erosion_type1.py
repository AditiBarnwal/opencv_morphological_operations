# eroding the outer surface (the foreground) of the image.
# binary images contain two pixels 0 and 255,
# first involves eroding the foreground of the image, and have the foreground as white.

# The thickness of erosion depends on the SIZE and SHAPE of the defined kernel.

# use NumPyâ€™s ones() function to define a kernel.
# other functions like NumPy zeros, customized kernels, and others that can be used to define kernels.
